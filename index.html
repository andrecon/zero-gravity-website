            <h4>Project Happy School</h4>
            <p> A voluntary government school makeover project inspired by the concept of Bala (building as a learning aid) which is an innovative way to look at the 
              relationship of a child with the school space. It is about developing the school’s entire physical environment as a learning aid-the inside, the outside, 
              everywhere. At the core it is about maximizing the educational value of built space through visual imagery. It emphasizes on the importance of the physical 
              learning environment, infrastructure and visuals in the overall educational process.
